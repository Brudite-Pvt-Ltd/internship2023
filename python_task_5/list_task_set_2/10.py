#10.Write a function that takes a list of integers as input and rearranges the elements so that all negative elements appear before the non-negative elements,and the order of elements with in each category remains unchanged. The goal is to do this in-place,i.e.,without using any additional datastructures.For example,given the list:[3,-1,-4,2,0,-5,6,-2],after rearranging, the output should be:[-1,-4,-5,-2,3,2,0,6].
